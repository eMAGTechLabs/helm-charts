daemonConfig:
  ## Sets the name of the log file to use.
  logfile: /dev/stdout

  ## Sets the level of detail for messages sent to the log file.
  ## This field has the same possible values as the agent, which are, in increasing order of detail: error|warning|info|debug
  # loglevel: info

  ## Sets the socket endpoint the daemon will listen on. This endpoint allows agents to communicate with the daemon.
  ## This must be the same value as the agent's newrelic.daemon.address setting.
  # address:

  ## This feature was introduced in version 3.4. When enabled, the agent will create an audit log, which contains all of the data sent from the daemon to New Relic.
  ## This data includes the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, un-encoded data for each request.
  ## This allows you to observe exactly what data is sent to New Relic in order to ensure no sensitive data is included.

resources: {}
  ## We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  ## choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  ## resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  ## lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
